      <h1>Designing</h1>
      <p>
        A good design can go a long way in defining your brand image and how
        responsible you are about the details. Designing isn’t just putting
        together a banner or a poster. A badly designed banner or poster, wrong
        choice of fonts and elements, bad alignments can ruin your brand image
        and show that your brand doesn’t know what its doing. A menu with bad
        font in a restaurant can strain your eyes, a badly designed poster can
        mislead the customer, a bad alignment of elements can say your brand
        isn’t organised and not worth the time of the customer. We can design
        everything for you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Websites</li>
        <li>Logo</li>
        <li>Letter Heads</li>
        <li>Menus</li>
        <li>Posters</li>
        <li>Banners</li>
        <li>Social Media Templates</li>
        <li>Advertisements</li>
        <li>Brochures</li>
        <li>Company Profiles and much more</li>
      </ul>
    </>
