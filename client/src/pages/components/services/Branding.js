      <p>
        Branding is something that defines your brand and lets your customers
        realise what you stand for. This doesn’t just include making Logos, this
        involves making a strategy about what to say and how to say it to your
        audience so they not only can see what you’re offering but why you’re
        doing what you’re doing. This involves:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Logo</li>
        <li>Packings</li>
        <li>
          Brand Strategy -- How to strategise your brand to strengthen the
          vision behind your brand in eyes of your audience
        </li>
        <li>
          Messaging -- What you say to your audience across different platforms
